    "**When to use Thread in Tkinter applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Tkinter application, the main loop should always start in the main thread. It’s responsible for handling events and updating the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a background operation that takes time, you should execute it in a separate thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the application won’t be responsive. In the worst case, it will freeze while the operation is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and control multiple threads in Tkinter applications, you can use the Python threading module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is included in Python’s standard library so you don’t need to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to use the threading module, you can follow the Python threading tutorial."
