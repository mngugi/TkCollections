    "**How to Change the Appearances of Widgets Dynamically Using Ttk Style map() Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "in this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the ttk Style map() method to dynamically change the appearance of a widget based on its specific state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a ttk widget allows you to change its appearance based on a specific state.\n",

    "| State      | Meaning |\n",
    "|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **active**      | The mouse is currently within the widget. |\n",
    "| **alternate**   | Ttk reserved this state for application use. |\n",
    "| **background**  | The widget is on a window that is not the foreground window. The foreground window is a window that is getting user inputs. This state is only relevant to Windows and macOS. |\n",
    "| **disabled**    | The widget won’t respond to any actions. |\n",
    "| **focus**       | The widget currently has focus. |\n",
    "| **invalid**     | The value of the widget is currently invalid. |\n",
    "| **pressed**     | The widget is currently being clicked or pressed (e.g., when a Button widget is pressed). |\n",
    "| **readonly**    | The readonly widget prevents you from changing its current value (e.g., a read-only Entry widget won’t allow you to change its text contents). |\n",
    "| **selected**    | The widget is selected (e.g., when radio buttons are checked). |\n"
