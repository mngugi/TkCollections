    "Each row and column in the grid is identified by an index. By default, the first row has an index of zero, the second row has an index of one, and so on. Likewise, the columns in the grid have indexes of zero, one, two, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indexes of rows and columns in a grid don’t have to start at zero. In addition, the row and column indexes can have gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can have a grid whose column indexes are 1, 2, 10, 11, and 12. This is useful when you plan to add more widgets in the middle of the grid later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection of a row and a column is called a cell. A cell is an area where you can place a widget. A cell can hold only one widget. If you place two widgets in a cell, they’ll be on top of each other.\n",
