    "Tkinter has two generations of widgets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The old classic tk widgets. Tkinter introduced them in 1991.\n",
    "- The newer themed ttk widgets added in 2007 with Tk 8.5. The newer Tk themed widgets replace many (but not all) classic widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that ttk stands for Tk themed. Therefore, Tk themed widgets are the same as ttk widgets\n",
