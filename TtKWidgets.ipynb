    "\n",
    "- The old classic tk widgets. Tkinter introduced them in 1991.\n",
    "- The newer themed ttk widgets added in 2007 with Tk 8.5. The newer Tk themed widgets replace many (but not all) classic widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that ttk stands for Tk themed. Therefore, Tk themed widgets are the same as ttk widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "The tkinter.ttk module contains all the new ttk widgets. It’s a good practice to always use themed widgets whenever they’re available.\n",

    "### Advantages of using Tk themed widgets\n",
    "By using the Tk themed widgets, you gain the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separating the widget’s behavior and appearance – the ttk widgets attempt to separate the code that implements the widgets’ behaviors from their appearance through the styling system.\n",
    "- Native look & feel – the ttk widgets have the native look and feel of the platform on which the program runs.\n",
    "- Simplify the state-specific widget behaviors – the ttk widgets simplify and generalize the state-specific widget behavior.\n"
