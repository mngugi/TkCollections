    "\n",
    "A Spinbox has an area for displaying the current value and a pair of arrowheads.\n",

    "When you click the upward-pointing arrowhead, the Spinbox advances to the next higher value in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current value reaches the maximum, you can set it to the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you click the downward-pointing arrowhead, the Spinbox decreases the current value to the next lower value in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current value reaches the lowest, you can set it to the maximum.\n",
