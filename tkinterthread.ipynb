    "**When to use Thread in Tkinter applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Tkinter application, the main loop should always start in the main thread. It’s responsible for handling events and updating the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a background operation that takes time, you should execute it in a separate thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the application won’t be responsive. In the worst case, it will freeze while the operation is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and control multiple threads in Tkinter applications, you can use the Python threading module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is included in Python’s standard library so you don’t need to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to use the threading module, you can follow the Python threading tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, import tkinter, threading, and requests modules:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import tkinter as tk\n",
    "from tkinter import ttk\n",
    "from tkinter.messagebox import showerror\n",
    "from threading import Thread\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, define a new class called AsyncDownload that inherits from the Thread class:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class AsyncDownload(Thread):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, url):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.html = None\n",
    "        self.url = url\n",
    "\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        response = requests.get(self.url)\n",
    "        self.html = response.text\n",
    "```\n",
    "How the AsyncDownload class works:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the __init__() method of the AsyncDownload class, we initialize the html and url attributes.\n",
    "In the run() method, we call the get the get() function to download the webpage specified by the URL and assign the HTML source code to the html attribute.\n",
    "After that, create the App class inherits from the Tk class. The App class represents the root window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root window consists of three frames that hold all the widgets. We won’t focus on how to create widgets and place them on the window using the grid geometry manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click the download button, the program executes the handle_download() method of the App class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the handle_download() method, we check if the url is provided. If yes, we create a new instance of the AsyncDownload class and start the thread. Also, we disable the download button and clear the contents of the Text widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we call the monitor() method to monitor the status of the thread.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def handle_download(self):\n",
    "    url = self.url_var.get()\n",
    "    if url:\n",
    "        self.download_button['state'] = tk.DISABLED\n",
    "        self.html.delete(1.0, \"end\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        download_thread = AsyncDownload(url)\n",
    "        download_thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "        self.monitor(download_thread)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        showerror(title='Error',\n",
    "                message='Please enter the URL of the webpage.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the monitor() method, we schedule an action that will run the monitor() method after 100ms if the thread is still alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the download completed, we update the contents for the Entry widget and re-enable the download button:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def monitor(self, thread):\n",
    "    if thread.is_alive():\n",
    "        # check the thread every 100ms\n",
    "        self.after(100, lambda: self.monitor(thread))\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        self.html.insert(1.0, thread.html)\n",
    "        self.download_button['state'] = tk.NORMAL\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, run the application’s main loop:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app = App()\n",
    "    app.mainloop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following show the complete program:\n"
