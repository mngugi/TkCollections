    "**Introduction to the Frame tkraise() method**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a Tkinter application consists of multiple frames. And you often need to switch between frames to display the one that is relevant to the user’s choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tkinter allows you to stack frames on top of each other. To show a particular frame, you can simply raise one above the other in the stacking order. The top frame will be visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bring a frame to the top, you use the tkraise() method of the Frame widget like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`frame.tkraise()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Frame tkraise() method example**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you’ll extend the temperature converter application by adding the conversion of a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, the application converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you select the C to F radio button, the application shows a new frame that allows you to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To build this application, you’ll need to have three main widgets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A root window.\n",
    "- The ConverterFrame that shows the form fields.\n",
    "- And the ControlFrame that shows the radio buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ConverterFrame will have two instances, one that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and the other that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, define a TemperatureConverter class that has two static methods: fahrenheit_to_celsius and celsius_to_fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class TemperatureConverter:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def fahrenheit_to_celsius(f, format=True):\n",
    "        result = (f - 32) * 5/9\n",
    "        if format:\n",
    "            return f'{f} Fahrenheit = {result:.2f} Celsius'\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def celsius_to_fahrenheit(c, format=True):\n",
    "        result = c * 9/5 + 32\n",
    "        if format:\n",
    "            return f'{c} Celsius = {result:.2f} Fahrenheit'\n",
